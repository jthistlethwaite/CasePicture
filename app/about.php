        Industrial photography made easy.
    </p>

    <p>
        CasePicture is a simple tool for capturing a high volume of photographs and keeping them organized by
        subject matter.

        <h2>
            A story...
        </h2>
        <p>
            A small warehouse needed to photograph hundreds, sometimes thousands of packages received each day. These pictures
            would often need to be found later and sometimes sent to their customers for shipping insurance claims. One lost
            picture could lead to hundreds of dollars in losses.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Keeping track of that many pictures is a nightmare.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Smart phones and digital cameras didn't cut it. They were too slow and locating pictures later could take hours.
            Employees would have to transfer hundreds of pictures from a phone to a computer and search through them, often
            weeks after the picture had been taken. It could take hours.
        </p>

        <p>
            On top of that, devices ran out of space, employees forgot to transfer pictures to computers, and cameras would
            be lost or damaged.
        </p>


        <h3>CasePicture solves this problem:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Any device with a camera and Wifi can be used to take pictures</li>
            <li>All pictures are named using the subject matter and date taken</li>
            <li>Pictures are stored in a central file share</li>
            <li>
                Pictures can be searched by subject and date in seconds
            </li>
            <li>
                CasePicture easily integrates with cloud storage solutions, like Amazon S3 or Dropbox.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
